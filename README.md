# 🤖 CodeHallucinator

**AI-fy your codebase instantly.**

Are you still coding by hand? 🤢 Are your coworkers making fun of you for _actually understanding_ what your code does? Embarrassing.

With the mighty **CodeHallucinator**, you can instantly transform your sad, human-written code into something that looks like it's been ✨ vibe coded ✨ by a caffeinated AI at 3am. No more imposter syndrome—now you can be a _real_ imposter!

CodeHallucinator is a CLI tool that injects corporate jargon, random emojis, meaningless TODOs, and "AI-generated" logic into your JavaScript files. Because why write clean, maintainable code when you can have **AI-verified** spaghetti?

## Features

- **JSDoc Inflation**: Turns 1-line functions into 10-line documentation masterpieces.
- **Emoji-fication**: Adds ✨ sparkle ✨ to your comments.
- **Console Spam**: Logs "System optimal..." and "Downloading RAM..." at random intervals.
- **TODO Bombing**: Adds tasks like `// TODO: Refactor this to use Blockchain`.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g code-hallucinator
```

## Usage

Run it on your project (make sure to commit first, this is destructive!):

```bash
hallucinate "**/*.{js,ts}"
```

Or output to a separate folder (preserves your originals):

```bash
hallucinate "**/*.{js,ts}" --out-dir hallucinated
```

Or try a dry run:

```bash
hallucinate "**/*.{js,ts}" --dry-run
```

## Example

**Before:**

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

**After:**

```javascript
/* 🤖 GENERATED BY CODE-HALLUCINATOR. PROCEED WITH CAUTION. 🤖 */
/**

 *
 * @param {any} input - The input vector/tensor/thing.
 * @returns {Promise<void>} - A promise that resolves when the entropy is sufficiently high.
 * @ai-generated true
 * @confidence 0.001%
 */
function add(a, b) {
  console.log('Aligning chakras...');
  return a + b;
}
```
